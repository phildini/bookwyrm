# Contributing to BookWyrm

Our goal is to make BookWyrm a kind and welcoming place where everyone can contribute to the success of the project. Here are some ways you can join the project:

## Report things that are confusing

We want BookWyrm to be a fun experience that is intuitive to understand. If you're confused by something, it's probably because it is confusing! We are always keen to improve our [documentation](https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com) and Guided Tour as well as the platform itself.

You can [create an issue to improve our documentation](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/documentation/issues) or if you prefer, [ask for help in our Matrix chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#bookwyrm:matrix.org).

## Report bugs

Sometimes things don't work the way we intended. We would love to have fewer bugs, but we can only fix them if we know about them.

You can [report bugs](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues) by clicking "New Issue". The more information you can provide, the easier it will be to understand the problem and squash that bug!

It's a good idea to search the Issues for key words associated with your bug first because someone else may have already reported it.

## Request and discuss new features

Got a great idea for an improvement to BookWyrm? You can [request new features](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues) by clicking "New Issue".

It's a good idea to search the Issues for key words associated with your feature suggestion first because someone else may have already requested it.

## Translate BookWyrm into international languages

Books are written in many languages, and BookWyrm should be too. If you know more than one language, you might be able to help us to [translate BookWyrm](https://translate.joinbookwyrm.com/). You can find out more about translation [in the documentation](https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com/translation.html).

## Keep the documentation up to date

Good documentation is crucial so that people know how to use, contribute to, and administer BookWyrm. No matter how you are involved with BookWyrm, your perspective is valuable and you can contribute to our documentation.

We managed documentation in [a separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/documentation) where you can [log a documentation issue](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/documentation/issues) or contribute to the documentation yourself.

## Test draft versions

Are you a BookWyrm instance administrator? You can help to test new features when we release them in a draft version of BookWyrm, and report back on your experiences. This is crucial to helping us to release stable versions with fewer bugs.

## Contribute code

If you're able to write code, you can contribute that way! Check out the [Guide to the developer environment](https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com/install-dev.html) and our code [style guide](https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com/style_guide.html).

## Provide expert advice

Bibliographic metadata wizard? Celery nerd? ActivityPub expert? SQL query obsessive? We need all kinds of expertise! You can contribute to discussions in [the Issues](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues) or reach out to make suggestions [in our Matrix chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#bookwyrm:matrix.org) or via an Issue of your own.
